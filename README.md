## Featured Projects

### 🔹 [MQL5-Projects](https://github.com/newnes/MT5-Projects)
MKTS-Projects: A quantitative research lab fusing fractal mathematics and capital flow analysis to build advanced trading tools and indicators.

### 🔹 [Comparative-Pivot-Point-Models](https://github.com/newnes/Comparative-Pivot-Point-Models)
Comparative evaluation between public pivot point models and a proprietary proximity-based model across 482 trading days (SPY ETF, 1-min timeframe).

### 🔹 [Series Sound](https://github.com/newnes/Time-Series-Sound)
**Sonification of financial time series through spectral analysis and musical note mapping.**  
This project transforms percentage changes in financial time series into audible frequencies using harmonic proportions and fundamental frequency detection. It generates both a CSV file with the mapped notes and a WAV audio file for auditory analysis.

## Research Frameworks

🔹 Finite Lifetime Convexity Optimization (FLCO)

A quantitative capital allocation framework designed for individuals operating under finite and uncertain human lifetime constraints.

Traditional portfolio optimization models implicitly assume long or indefinite horizons and prioritize volatility-adjusted performance metrics. FLCO reformulates the objective function by explicitly incorporating lifetime uncertainty as a stochastic constraint in the decision process.

Instead of maximizing return per unit of variance, FLCO defines the optimization objective as:

**Maximize:**  
`P( τ_π ≤ T )`

Where:  
- `τ_π` = stopping time required for strategy `π` to reach a predefined wealth target  
- `T` = remaining lifetime modeled as a random variable

Under this framework, strategy evaluation emphasizes:  
- Positive convexity and asymmetric payoff structures  
- Geometric growth rate (GHPR)  
- Probability of ruin and capital survivability  
- Inter-arrival time of extreme gains  
- Cross-regime robustness

FLCO integrates stochastic growth theory, convex payoff dynamics, and mortality-adjusted decision modeling into a unified framework for accelerated wealth transformation.

📌 Whitepaper, mathematical formalization, and Monte Carlo simulations in development.
